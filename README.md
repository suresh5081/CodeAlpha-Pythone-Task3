Task automation using Python scripting involves using Python's programming capabilities to automate repetitive tasks, streamline workflows, and improve productivity. Python is particularly well-suited for task automation due to its simplicity, readability, and the availability of a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.



>File Organization:

The organize_files_by_extension function organizes files in a specified folder by their file extensions. It creates a folder for each file type (e.g., .jpg, .txt) and moves the files into the respective folders.



>Data Cleaning:

The clean_csv_data function loads a CSV file into a pandas Data Frame, removes duplicates, handles missing values by filling them with the median of each column, and saves the cleaned data to a new file.



>System Maintenance:

The Delete_old_files function scans a folder and deletes files that are older than a specified number of days (default is 30 days). This helps in cleaning up old or unnecessary files.



>How to Use:

Modify the paths in the main function to match your specific directories and files.

Run the script in your Python environment.

This script can be easily extended or modified to include additional tasks as needed.
